Description: This package provides convenience functions for statistical analysis workflows with tidy
    (data.frame/tibble) outputs. It currently focuses on one-way omnibus tests and post-hoc pairwise
    comparisons, including effect sizes, confidence intervals (optionally adjusted), and
    multiple-comparison p-value adjustments, and will be extended to additional methods in future
    versions.
